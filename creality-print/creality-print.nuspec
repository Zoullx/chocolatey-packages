This is a nuspec. It mostly adheres to https://docs.nuget.org/create/Nuspec-Reference. Chocolatey uses a special version of NuGet.Core that allows us to do more than was initially possible. As such there are certain things to be aware of:

* the package xmlns schema url may cause issues with nuget.exe
* Any of the following elements can ONLY be used by choco tools - projectSourceUrl, docsUrl, mailingListUrl, bugTrackerUrl, packageSourceUrl, provides, conflicts, replaces
* nuget.exe can still install packages with those elements but they are ignored. Any authoring tools or commands will error on those elements

<!-- You can embed software files directly into packages, as long as you are not bound by distribution rights. -->
<!-- * If you are an organization making private packages, you probably have no issues here -->
<!-- * If you are releasing to the community feed, you need to consider distribution rights. -->

Versatile Copilot for FDM Printers
Cloud Model Library
Streamlined Workflow
Data Secure LAN Printing
Refined for Print Quality
More Than Just a Slicer
3-stage Workflow, Simple to Follow
Prepare
Import and adjust the model. Apply printer filament, and quality presets.
Preview
Enjoy one-click slicing and extensive slice preview options.
Device
Add your devices by QR Code or IP address. Enjoy data-secure LAN printing.
3D Model Download and Slicing in One Go
Cloud Model Library Integrated
500,000+ 3D models as of Nov. 2023
Adjust 3D Models Like a Breeze
Rotation, scaling, lettering, support, shell extraction, bottom placement, hole drilling, and more. Handy to personalize the model as you like.
Auto Layout
Layout options available to make full use of the build surface when batch-printing small objects.
Model Splitting
Easy to split a big model into small pieces with ease. The gap in between as also adjustable.
Letter Adding
Customize each model and make your mark by adding a name, brand or any letters to it.
Quick Slicing with Rich Presets
Printer, filament, quality presets
Also supports Klipper printers.
Fine-tuning with Advanced Settings
Switch to advanced mode, and a plethora of detailed controls are available. Take your time to dial in the parameters for the printer, filament and quality, until get exactly what you want.
All Subtleties Revealed in Slice Preview
The G-code file can be viewed and checked by various attributes such as speed, structure, flow, layer time, fan speed, etc. Every print path or layer can be inspected in so much detail that you won't miss a hair.
Also a Productive 3D Printing Studio
LAN Printing (Off-cloud)
Export to Local
Upload to Creality Cloud
Print &amp; Control Remotely over Data-secure LAN
Visual monitoring of the printing process;
Granular Remote control (covering start/pause, fan speed, LED, etc.);
Save time-lapse video to the local;
Import G-code files for remote printing;
Keep all data secure on the local area network (LAN)
Upload Files to Creality Cloud for Printing
With slice files uploaded to the pesonal center, you can share them directly from the cloud. Enjoy the freedom of cloud printing beyond the limit of space and time.
Efficient Running of Your Print Farm
You can do multiple print tasks at the same time, and manage dozens of devices in real time. No sweat to run a print farm by just one person.
So Many Optimizations for Print Quality
Better Overhangs in Sharp Style
One overhang is divided into several sections according to the slanting angles. The section with larger angles will be printed at a slower speed and cooled by a stronger wind. Thanks to the staged speed and smart cooling, each overhang can set adequately in crisp shapes.
Ideal Paths Planned for Printing
Each printing path is made optimal. An epic leap in both print quality and speed.
Variable Line Width
Create lines of exact width to fill irregular gaps and print ultra thin walls.
Arc Fitting
Simulate arc patch with fewer, smooth arc segments instead of linear segments.
Slim Tree Support for Easy Removal
Slim tree support is introduced in addition to normal support and strong tree support. It is easier to remove for delivering intact prints. A great help with complex 3D models.
Less Stringing with Meticulous Retraction
Retraction is refined by combining nozzle wiping, retraction distance, Z-hop and speed adjustments. Gone is stringing, and what comes out are clean and tidy prints.
Excellent Calibration for Any Filament
With built-in calibration 3D models, you can easily calibrate for any filament by trying different parameters and observing the print quality. It paves your way to a 3D slicing expert.
More Worthy Optimizations
Creality Print also adopts vibration avoidance, motion advance, and bed adhesion options. Complex structures, small features, edges and details all become better.
