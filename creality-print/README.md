# 3D Model Download and Slicing in One Go

# Cloud Model Library Integrated

500,000+ 3D models as of Nov. 2023

### Adjust 3D Models Like a Breeze

Rotation, scaling, lettering, support, shell extraction, bottom placement, hole drilling, and more. Handy to personalize the model as you like.

### Auto Layout

Layout options available to make full use of the build surface when batch-printing small objects.

### Model Splitting

Easy to split a big model into small pieces with ease. The gap in between as also adjustable.

### Letter Adding

Customize each model and make your mark by adding a name, brand or any letters to it.

### Quick Slicing with Rich Presets

#### Printer, filament, quality presets

Also supports Klipper printers.

### Fine-tuning with Advanced Settings

Switch to advanced mode, and a plethora of detailed controls are available. Take your time to dial in the parameters for the printer, filament and quality, until get exactly what you want.

### All Subtleties Revealed in Slice Preview

The G-code file can be viewed and checked by various attributes such as speed, structure, flow, layer time, fan speed, etc. Every print path or layer can be inspected in so much detail that you won't miss a hair.

# Also a Productive 3D Printing Studio

- LAN Printing (Off-cloud)
- Export to Local
- Upload to Creality Cloud

### Print &amp; Control Remotely over Data-secure LAN

- Visual monitoring of the printing process;
- Granular Remote control (covering start/pause, fan speed, LED, etc.);
- Save time-lapse video to the local;
- Import G-code files for remote printing;
- Keep all data secure on the local area network (LAN)

### Upload Files to Creality Cloud for Printing

With slice files uploaded to the pesonal center, you can share them directly from the cloud. Enjoy the freedom of cloud printing beyond the limit of space and time.

### Efficient Running of Your Print Farm

You can do multiple print tasks at the same time, and manage dozens of devices in real time. No sweat to run a print farm by just one person.

# So Many Optimizations for Print Quality

### Better Overhangs in Sharp Style

One overhang is divided into several sections according to the slanting angles. The section with larger angles will be printed at a slower speed and cooled by a stronger wind. Thanks to the staged speed and smart cooling, each overhang can set adequately in crisp shapes.

### Ideal Paths Planned for Printing

Each printing path is made optimal. An epic leap in both print quality and speed.

## Variable Line Width

Create lines of exact width to fill irregular gaps and print ultra thin walls.

## Arc Fitting

Simulate arc patch with fewer, smooth arc segments instead of linear segments.

### Slim Tree Support for Easy Removal

Slim tree support is introduced in addition to normal support and strong tree support. It is easier to remove for delivering intact prints. A great help with complex 3D models.

### Less Stringing with Meticulous Retraction

Retraction is refined by combining nozzle wiping, retraction distance, Z-hop and speed adjustments. Gone is stringing, and what comes out are clean and tidy prints.

### Excellent Calibration for Any Filament

With built-in calibration 3D models, you can easily calibrate for any filament by trying different parameters and observing the print quality. It paves your way to a 3D slicing expert.

### More Worthy Optimizations

Creality Print also adopts vibration avoidance, motion advance, and bed adhesion options. Complex structures, small features, edges and details all become better.
