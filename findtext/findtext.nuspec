<!-- Read this before creating packages: https://docs.chocolatey.org/en-us/create/create-packages -->

This is a nuspec. It mostly adheres to https://docs.nuget.org/create/Nuspec-Reference. Chocolatey uses a special version of NuGet.Core that allows us to do more than was initially possible. As such there are certain things to be aware of:

* the package xmlns schema url may cause issues with nuget.exe
* Any of the following elements can ONLY be used by choco tools - projectSourceUrl, docsUrl, mailingListUrl, bugTrackerUrl, packageSourceUrl, provides, conflicts, replaces
* nuget.exe can still install packages with those elements but they are ignored. Any authoring tools or commands will error on those elements
-->

<!-- You can embed software files directly into packages, as long as you are not bound by distribution rights. -->
<!-- * If you are an organization making private packages, you probably have no issues here -->
<!-- * If you are releasing to the community feed, you need to consider distribution rights. -->
<!-- Do not remove this test for UTF-8: if “Ω” doesn’t appear as greek uppercase omega letter enclosed in quotation marks, you should use an editor that supports UTF-8, not this one. -->

# FindText

Capture screen image into text and then find it

1. Capture the image to text string.

2. Test find the text string on full Screen.

3. When test is successful, you may copy the code and paste it into your own script. Note: Copy the "FindText()" function and the following functions and paste it into your own script Just once.

4. The more recommended way is to save the script as "FindText.ahk" and copy it to the "Lib" subdirectory of AHK program, instead of copying the "FindText()" function and the following functions, add a line to the beginning of your script: #Include &lt;FindText&gt;

5. If you want to call a method in the "FindTextClass" class, use the parameterless FindText() to get the default object
